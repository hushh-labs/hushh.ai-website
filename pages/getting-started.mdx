## Overview

Hushh Agentic Developer APIs let you build consent-first personalization with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) JSON-RPC 2.0 workflows. Use the testable `/api/a2a/{agent}` endpoints in the docs to prototype, then move server-to-server for production workloads.

## The story: from first signal to activated profile

Imagine a luxury retail app onboarding Ava. She shares her email, selects a few style preferences, and explicitly consents to profile enrichment. Your app then:

<StepProcess steps={[
  {
    icon: "Fingerprint",
    title: "Consented Identity",
    description: "Create a clean profile record in Supabase with user consent.",
    snippet: "POST /v1/user/create"
  },
  {
    icon: "Sparkles",
    title: "Agentic Enrichment",
    description: "Enrich profile with public and Gemini agents for deeper context.",
    snippet: "POST /v1/agents/enrich"
  },
  {
    icon: "Database",
    title: "Normalization",
    description: "Normalize the profile into CRM-friendly likes, dislikes, and affinities.",
    snippet: "{ likes: ['Gucci', 'Prada'], dislikes: [] }"
  },
  {
    icon: "Send",
    title: "Activation",
    description: "Activate that profile in your CDP or personalization engine.",
    snippet: "SYNC -> Salesforce CDP"
  }
]} />

The result is a profile that is consented, current, and actionable.

## Make your first request

Try it out right here. Use Ava as a reference profile to test the public agent.

<InteractiveEndpoint 
  method="POST" 
  path="/api/a2a/public" 
  description="Enrich a profile using public data agents."
  curlCommand={`curl -X POST "https://hushh.ai/api/a2a/public" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \\
  -d "{\\"text\\":\\"Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001.\\",\\"sessionId\\":\\"session-123\\",\\"id\\":\\"task-abc123\\"}"`}
  responseExample={`{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "profile": {
      "name": "Sundar Pichai",
      "role": "CEO of Alphabet and Google",
      "known_for": ["Chrome", "Android", "Google Drive"],
      "affinities": ["Technology", "Leadership", "Product Management"]
    }
  },
  "id": "task-abc123"
}`}
/>

## Example identity payload

```json
{
  "text": "Create a profile for Ava Torres with email ava.torres@example.com, phone +1 4155550199, city San Francisco, and interests luxury retail, travel, wellness.",
  "sessionId": "session-456",
  "id": "task-789"
}
```

## Common pitfalls to avoid

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use live endpoints from the browser implementation in production. Always move to server-to-server communication to protect your API keys.

- Skipping consent metadata before enrichment.
- Storing raw agent outputs without normalization.
