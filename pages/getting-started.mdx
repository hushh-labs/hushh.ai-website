# Getting Started

## Overview

Hushh Agentic Developer APIs let you build consent-first personalization with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) JSON-RPC 2.0 workflows. Use the testable `/api/a2a/{agent}` endpoints in the docs to prototype, then move server-to-server for production workloads.

## The story: from first signal to activated profile

Imagine a luxury retail app onboarding Ava. She shares her email, selects a few style preferences, and explicitly consents to profile enrichment. Your app then:

1. Creates a clean profile record in Supabase.
2. Enriches it with public and Gemini agents for deeper context.
3. Normalizes the profile into CRM-friendly likes, dislikes, and affinities.
4. Activates that profile in your CDP or personalization engine.

The result is a profile that is consented, current, and actionable.

## What you will build

1. Create or query a profile in Supabase.
2. Enrich the profile with public and Gemini agents.
3. Normalize likes, dislikes, and brand affinities.
4. Activate the merged profile in your CRM or CDP.

## What success looks like

- A single merged JSON profile that is ready for segmentation.
- A clear consent trail for every enrichment step.
- Faster personalization without manual data wrangling.

## Prerequisites

- A Hushh developer account.
- An API key and session token.
- A minimal identity payload (email or phone).

## Base URL

`https://hushh.ai`

## Your first workflow (story-driven)

Use Ava as a reference profile. Start by enriching public data, then run Gemini for gap filling, and finally normalize the profile for brand activation.

## Make your first request

```bash
curl -X POST "https://hushh.ai/api/a2a/public" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"text\":\"Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001.\",\"sessionId\":\"session-123\",\"id\":\"task-abc123\"}"
```

## Example identity payload

```json
{
  "text": "Create a profile for Ava Torres with email ava.torres@example.com, phone +1 4155550199, city San Francisco, and interests luxury retail, travel, wellness.",
  "sessionId": "session-456",
  "id": "task-789"
}
```

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Using live endpoints from the browser. Use the doc endpoints for testing, then move to server-to-server.
- Skipping consent metadata before enrichment.
- Storing raw agent outputs without normalization.
