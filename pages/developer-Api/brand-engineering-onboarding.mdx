# Brand Engineering Onboarding (Hushh Agentic Developer APIs)

This guide is for enterprise brand engineering teams at LVMH, Reliance, and similar groups. It explains how to activate consented customer intelligence using Hushh Agentic Developer APIs orchestrated by MuleSoft.

## Outcomes (product)

- Faster onboarding with fewer forms and higher opt-in rates
- Rich customer profiles that power personalization and clienteling
- A consistent consent and audit model across brands and regions

## Architecture (engineering)

```
Brand app or data pipeline
  -> Hushh Agentic Developer APIs (/api/a2a)
  -> MuleSoft agent mesh (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  -> Public + Gemini enrichment
  -> Supabase profile create/query/update
  -> Brand CRM normalization
  -> CRM / CDP / personalization
```

<Callout type="info">
All profile access requires explicit user consent. Request consent before enrichment or activation.
</Callout>

## Guided onboarding

<Steps>
### 1) Create your developer account
Set up your org profile so consent prompts display your brand identity.

### 2) Verify your data flows
Confirm your profile creation and query calls in the sandbox.

### 3) Enable enrichment
Turn on Public Data and Gemini Data agents for higher-confidence profiles.

### 4) Normalize brand affinities
Use the Brand User Data Query Agent to produce CRM-ready likes and dislikes.

### 5) Optional: Plaid signals
If enabled, map Plaid merchant and category data into brand affinity fields before CRM activation.
</Steps>

## End-to-end example (Sundar Pichai)

### Create a profile

```http
POST /api/a2a/hushh-profile
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Create a profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
}
```

### Enrich with OpenAI and Gemini

```http
POST /api/a2a/public
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
}
```

```http
POST /api/a2a/gemini
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
}
```

### Normalize likes, dislikes, and brand affinity

```http
POST /api/a2a/brand
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Summarize likes, dislikes, and brand affinity for Sundar Pichai."
}
```

### Merge and activate
Merge in this order for best accuracy:
`brand -> hushh -> public -> gemini`
