# Use Cases (Agentic APIs)

This page focuses on developer-driven use cases for the Hushh Agentic Developer APIs.

## Luxury clienteling (LVMH)

- Cross-maison visibility into consented preferences
- VIP outreach informed by Public and Gemini enrichment
- Brand affinity signals mapped into CRM segments

## Retail and telecom ecosystems (Reliance)

- Unified profiles across Jio, retail, and digital products
- Lower onboarding friction with Day 0 enrichment
- Consent-led personalization at scale

## Example workflow (Sundar Pichai)

```http
POST /api/a2a/hushh-profile
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Create a profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
}
```

```http
POST /api/a2a/public
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
}
```

```http
POST /api/a2a/gemini
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
}
```

```http
POST /api/a2a/brand
Content-Type: application/json

## Implementation notes

- MuleSoft orchestrates all agent calls using JSON-RPC 2.0
- Plaid signals (if enabled) are added server side before brand normalization
