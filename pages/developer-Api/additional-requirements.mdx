# Additional Requirements

These requirements keep Hushh Agentic Developer API integrations safe, reliable, and compliant.

## Consent and governance

- Request explicit user consent before any enrichment or activation.
- Respect consent scope and purpose limitations in your product UI.
- Stop retrieval and activation when consent is revoked.
- Store consent receipts for audit and compliance.

## Security and privacy

- Use HTTPS for all calls.
- Store API keys and secrets in a secure vault.
- Restrict Plaid calls to server-to-server traffic only.

## JSON-RPC and A2A protocol

All MuleSoft agent calls use JSON-RPC 2.0 with the A2A message envelope.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "task-124",
  "method": "tasks/send",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "session-456",
    "message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Provide a detailed JSON profile for Sundar Pichai, email sundar.pichai@example.com, phone +1 6505559001."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Reliability and timeouts

- Use retries with exponential backoff on `500` and timeout errors.
- Keep prompts concise to reduce agent latency.
- Track `sessionId` and `id` for auditability.

## Compliance

- Follow GDPR and regional privacy laws for data access and retention.
- Collect only the data required for the agreed business purpose.
- Maintain an audit log for consent, access, and activation.
- Define a retention policy for derived profiles and purge on request.
