# Support

This section helps engineering and product teams troubleshoot integrations with Hushh Agentic Developer APIs.

## Contact

- Sales and partnerships: sales@hushh.ai
- Technical support: support@hushh.ai (Enterprise SLAs available by contract.)

## What to include in a support request

Provide these fields so we can trace your agent calls quickly:

- Organization name and environment (sandbox or production)
- Endpoint path (for example `/api/a2a/public`)
- `sessionId` and `id` from your JSON-RPC payload
- Timestamp and timezone
- Response snippet with `upstreamStatus` (if using `/api/a2a`)

## Common issues and fixes

### 400 Invalid JSON-RPC
- Cause: malformed payload or missing `jsonrpc`, `method`, or `params`.
- Fix: validate the JSON-RPC structure and resend.

### 401 Unauthorized
- Cause: invalid credentials or missing authorization in the MuleSoft flow.
- Fix: rotate your API key in the console and retry.

### 500 Internal Agent Error
- Cause: upstream agent failed or timed out.
- Fix: retry with exponential backoff and send the request ID to support if it persists.

### Timeout
- Cause: payload too large or upstream agent latency.
- Fix: reduce the prompt length or split the request into smaller tasks.

## Debugging tips

- Use `/api/a2a/{agent}` for browser-based testing in these docs.
- Call direct MuleSoft endpoints from your backend only (no browser secrets).
- Always include `sessionId` and `id` for end-to-end tracing.
