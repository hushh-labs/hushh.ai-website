## Step-by-step onboarding (start at <a href="https://hushhtech.com/onboarding/step-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hushhtech.com/onboarding/step-1</a>)

### Step 0: Sign in
Use Google or Apple to sign in. If you are new, you will be routed directly into onboarding.

### Step 1: Select your account tier
Choose the investment level that fits your goals:
- Hushh Wealth Investment Account (minimum 1M or 5M)
- Hushh Ultra High Net Worth Investment Account (minimum 25M)

### Step 2: Portfolio introduction
A quick overview of the portfolio and the questions that follow.

### Step 3: Choose Hushh Fund A share classes
Select units across share classes (you can choose multiple):
- Class A: 25M per unit
- Class B: 5M per unit
- Class C: 1M per unit

This sets your initial investment allocation for Hushh Fund A (AI-powered multi-strategy alpha).

### Step 4: Tell us how you heard about us (optional)
Pick a referral source or skip.

### Step 5: Personal info intro
We explain why we collect personal data for compliance and account setup.

### Step 6: Citizenship and residence
Confirm your country of citizenship and country of residence for tax and compliance requirements.

### Step 7: Account structure
Choose the account type:
- Individual
- Other

### Step 8: Phone number
Add a phone number (with country code) for verification and account security.

### Step 9: Legal name
Provide your legal first and last name.

### Step 10: Address
Enter your primary residential address (street, city, state, ZIP, country).

### Step 11: SSN and date of birth
Provide SSN and DOB for tax reporting and verification. You can skip SSN for now and continue with DOB, then complete SSN later. SSN is never shown on public profiles.

### Step 12: Final review checkpoint
A quick confirm screen before the investment summary.

### Step 13: Investment summary
Review your share class units and total investment. Minimum investment for Hushh Fund A is 1M.

### Step 14: Recurring investment (optional)
Set a recurring contribution schedule and amount, or choose "I will do this later." Custom amounts are supported (min 100, max 100M).

### Step 15: Wire transfer details (optional)
Add bank details for transfers (bank name, account holder, account number, routing number, country, account type). You can skip and add later.

### Step 16: Complete registration (human verification)
A one-time 1.00 USD human verification helps prevent bots and unlocks next steps. You can also book a CEO office hour after verification.
