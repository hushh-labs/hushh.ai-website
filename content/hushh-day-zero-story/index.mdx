# Hushh Agents Day 0 Story — Sundar Pichai

The Day 0 canvas is meant for investors and partners who want to see how Hushh stitches multiple agents together without exposing raw dashboards. Below is a single flow—from intake to concierge personalization—told through clean, repeatable beats.

## Day 0 at a Glance

| Minute | Agent | Action | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Supabase Profile Creation Agent | Concierge submits one-line brief (“Create Sundar Pichai…”) | UUID + base Supabase record drop with MCP audit log |
| 2 | GeminiAI Public Data Agent | Three identifiers trigger public-data sweep | Investor-ready JSON synced to Supabase + KYC workspace |
| 4 | Supabase Profile Update Agent | Compliance command confirms accreditation & risk profile | Accreditation, risk, and contact prefs patched everywhere |
| 6 | MuleSoft MCP Registry | Deterministic aliases minted | `https://hushh.ai/profile/phone/+16505559001` & `/sundar-pichai` issued |
| 7 | User Data Query Agent | Concierge asks for wants/needs via alias | Conversational brief + machine-readable payload returned |
| 9 | Brand User Data Query Agent | Nike concierge requests brand affinities | Lifestyle + gifting insights synced back to investor dashboards |

## Narrative Highlights

1. **Zero-Friction Intake** — The creation agent converts a single sentence into a structured Supabase profile, logging the call inside MuleSoft so every downstream agent inherits the same UUID.
2. **Public Data Enrichment** — GeminiAI enriches the record with executive history, philanthropy focus, and travel cadence, flagging confidence scores for regulated review.
3. **Compliance-Grade Updates** — A natural-language update command patches accreditation flags, risk tiers, and preferred verification channels, keeping Salesforce and the KYC schema aligned.
4. **Deterministic MCP Endpoint** — MuleSoft publishes both phone and alias URLs (`https://hushh.ai/profile/sundar-pichai`), turning the profile into an addressable service rather than another spreadsheet row.
5. **Concierge Intelligence** — The User Data Query Agent references the alias to answer “What matters most to Sundar right now?” delivering lifestyle cues plus raw JSON for the WhatsApp concierge.
6. **Brand & Partner Activation** — Brand teams tap the same alias via the Brand User Data Query Agent to tailor gifts and experiences, and the resulting insights loop back into investor-facing dashboards.

## Why It Resonates with Investors & Partners

> **Proof of orchestration:** A single VIP record touches five agents and two data planes (Supabase + Salesforce) without humans repeating inputs.
> 
> **Audit-ready privacy:** Every change is linked to the MCP alias, producing a replayable trail for KYC or security reviews.
> 
> **Instant personalization:** Within ten minutes, Sundar has a living profile that sales, support, and investor-relations bots can query safely.

Use this Day 0 story when sharing the Hushh Agents library with potential partners—it shows that intelligence, compliance, and personalization all arrive together, not as separate roadmap items.
