## 🧠 Hushh Brand User Data Query Agent

The Hushh Brand User Data Query Agent is an intelligent, AI-driven interface that identifies and records a user’s brand preferences through natural conversations with the User Personal Agent. Acting as a bridge between agentic experiences and Salesforce CRM, it captures, processes, and stores favorite or frequently engaged brands in a structured, marketing-ready format. The API is hosted on MuleSoft CloudHub, hardened with HTTPS, and showcased alongside other orchestration patterns on [`/agents`](/agents).

## 1. Overview

- **Mission:** Deliver instant brand affinity insights whenever a partner agent asks.
- **LLM Backbone:** `gpt-4.0-mini`.
- **Stack:** MuleSoft CloudHub, Supabase, Salesforce CRM, JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging.
- **Outcome:** Real-time personalization, segmentation, and intent prediction without manual lookups.

## 2. Concept Example — Brand Agent ↔ Sundar Pichai Agent

Imagine the Nike Brand Agent wants to tailor a concierge message for Sundar Pichai. Instead of performing manual searches, it simply asks the Hushh Brand Agent, “Tell me about Sundar’s lifestyle, purchase behavior, and brand preferences.” The Brand Agent then calls the Sundar Personal Agent, receives verified insights from Salesforce, and returns a contextualized answer. This conversational exchange transforms static CRM records into actionable intelligence for every brand assistant listed on [`/agents`](/agents).

## 3. Example Queries

| Query | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Can you fetch all the details of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Returns the complete user profile from Supabase. |
| Can you fetch all the intentions of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Retrieves intent data such as interests or plans. |
| Can you fetch all the wants of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Provides key wants or goals captured from activity. |
| Can you fetch all the desires of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Delivers aspirational data or inferred preferences. |
| What about the fitness details of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Shares lifestyle and health context. |

| Does the user like tea or coffee? | Surfaces preference-level lifestyle markers. |

## 4. How It Works

1. A brand agent or chatbot sends a natural-language question containing the user’s phone number.
2. The Hushh Brand Query Agent interprets the question using GPT-4.0 mini.
3. It retrieves structured data from Supabase and enriches it with Salesforce CRM fields.
4. The agent returns a conversational response plus machine-readable JSON so downstream systems can act immediately.

## User Stories

- **Boutique Fashion Lead:** Sundar Pichai hops into a live styling session and asks the Brand Agent, “What does this VIP prefer when traveling?” Within seconds she learns the client loves muted palettes and eco-friendly fabrics, letting her curate an outfit that feels personal.
- **Customer Experience Director:** Helio uses the agent to prep quarterly business reviews. By pulling each client’s wants, needs, and desires, he highlights how campaigns aligned with user intent, winning trust for the next experiment.
- **Subscription Manager:** Rohan notices churn risk on a premium plan. She queries the agent for the user’s aspirations and learns they value bespoke coaching, so she adds a white-glove check-in before sending any retention offer.
- **Influencer Partnership Lead:** Helina gets a request from a luxury brand wanting to understand a customer’s brand affinity before gifting. The agent returns preferred labels and gifting history, ensuring the brand picks something meaningful.
- **Field Marketer:** Sebastian travels between pop-ups. Before each event he pulls a list of RSVPs with their desires and intents, allowing him to tailor demos and product storytelling for every micro-segment.

## Architecture Notes & Pro Tips

- **Single-Source Graph:** Supabase acts as the canonical store, but Salesforce mirrors key attributes for GTM teams. The Brand Agent orchestrates bi-directional sync and exposes a consistent schema to every consumer.
- **LLM Reasoning Budget:** GPT-4.0 mini is tuned with system prompts describing tone (“confident concierge”) and safe completion rules, ensuring responses stay concise and on-brand.
- **Traceability:** Each query logs the phone number, prompt, response token count, and downstream system in BigQuery. This enables SOC teams to audit access patterns by brand.
