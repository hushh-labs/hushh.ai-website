## 🚀 Introduction

Apple’s server-based language model represents the other half of its AI story. While the on-device model powers quick, personal interactions, the server model handles complex, large-scale tasks—especially those requiring heavy computation or multimodal understanding.

Backed by a privacy-respecting infrastructure called Private Cloud Compute (PCC), Apple’s server LLM blends state-of-the-art architecture with mission-critical data protections.

## 🏛️ Architecture: PT-MoE

The architecture underpins everything:

- **Parallel Track Transformer:** Think of this as running several mini-models (tracks) in parallel. This drastically reduces the bottleneck from waiting on sequential layers.
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Instead of activating every neuron, only a few specialized “experts” are triggered—saving time and compute.
- **Global + Local Attention Fusion:** Interleaving these layers helps the model handle both focused local context and broad document-scale reasoning.
- **ASTC Compression:** Apple compresses server weights to 3.56 bits without quality loss, using GPU-accelerated decompression with zero runtime cost.

## 🌟 Visual Intelligence

Beyond text, this model excels in visual understanding:

- **ViT-g Backbone:** A powerful vision transformer trained on over 10B high-quality image-text pairs.
- **Register-Window Attention:** Helps the model understand fine-grained local details and high-level global context simultaneously.
- **Multi-modal Coherence:** From charts to infographics to scanned documents, this model “reads” like a human.

## 📊 Benchmarks & Accuracy

The numbers speak:

- **MMLU:** 80.2 | **MGSM:** 87.09
- Outperforms comparably sized models in STEM, multilingual, and visual reasoning
- Preferred in 56% of blind human evals

## 🌐 Language Reach

The server model has been rigorously evaluated for:

- **Locale-Specific Fluency:** “Football” in the UK, “soccer” in the US
- **Translation Memory:** Recalls prior terms across long documents
- **OCR in Multilingual Contexts:** Extracts data from signs, forms, even handwriting

## ⛨️ Privacy by Design

Thanks to Private Cloud Compute:

- All requests are encrypted in transit and at rest
- Processing happens on ephemeral, attested servers
- No data is stored or used for training

## 🚗 Use Case Examples

- Legal Document Parsing
- Multi-image Scene Understanding (e.g., travel itineraries)
- PDF to Knowledge Graph Conversion
- Visual Q&A bots
