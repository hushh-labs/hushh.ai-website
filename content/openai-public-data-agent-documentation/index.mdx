## OpenAI Public Data Agent Documentation

The OpenAI Public Data Agent is an AI-powered service inside the Hushh platform that enriches user profiles using publicly available signals. When a user enters only their name, email, or phone number inside the Hushh UI, the agent invokes GPT-4.0 mini to infer lifestyle, occupation, preferences, and behavior traits. The structured output fuels personalization, segmentation, and intent prediction, and the agent now sits alongside the rest of our orchestrated services on [`Agents`](/agents).

## 1. Overview

- **Purpose:** Generate detailed, realistic JSON profiles from minimal identifiers.
- **LLM Backbone:** gpt-4.0-mini.
- **Output:** userProfile JSON with demographics, interests, lifestyle cues, intents, and behavioral preferences.
- **Primary Consumers:** Hushh CRM, analytics dashboards, personalization engines, and marketing automations.

## 2. Functional Workflow

### Step 1: User Input (Hushh UI)
Customers provide basic details—name, email, phone number—during onboarding or consented journeys. This lightweight form factor keeps friction low.

### Step 2: Agent Invocation (MuleSoft Flow)
MuleSoft formats the payload as a JSON-RPC 2.0 POST and calls the OpenAI Public Data Agent endpoint, ensuring consistent authentication and retries across the multi-agent mesh.

### Step 3: Data Retrieval & Enrichment
The agent uses natural language inference and pattern-based enrichment to gather context from public sources. When information is unavailable, it generates reasonable placeholders so downstream systems always receive a complete dataset.

### Step 4: Structured Response
OpenAI returns a comprehensive `userProfile` JSON object that includes demographics, interests, lifestyle choices, intents, and behavioral preferences—ready for analytics or real-time personalization.

### Step 5: Integration with Hushh
The enriched payload is stored within Supabase/CRM layers and visualized in analytics dashboards, giving teams instant insight without manual research.

## Usage Example — Sundar Pichai Onboarding

When Sundar Pichai signs up with:

```json
{
  "name": "Sundhar Pichai",
  "email": "sundhar.pichai@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-0123"
}
```

the OpenAI Agent:

- Retrieves and enriches publicly available information.
- Builds a realistic, structured userProfile JSON.
- Sends it back to Hushh for visualization, personalization, and recommendations.

## Security & Privacy

- The agent only uses publicly accessible or synthetic placeholder data.
- No private or sensitive information is accessed or stored.
- All network calls run over HTTPS, and MuleSoft MCP enforces auth and auditability.
