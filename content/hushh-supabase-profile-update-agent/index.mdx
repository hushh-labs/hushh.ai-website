## Hushh Supabase Profile Update Agent Documentation

The Hushh Supabase Profile Update Agent is an AI-powered automation service that corrects or modifies user data inside Supabase using natural language. Acting as an intelligent intermediary between the Hushh UI and Supabase, it parses update requests—like “Update the state to AP for user +919346661428 with ID d6f5fca9-924b-492e-95f6-55e81d405174”—and executes them safely through MuleSoft and the MCP Server. As part of our agent catalog on [`/agents`](/agents), it ensures CRM, analytics, and personalization modules stay perfectly in sync.

## 1. Overview

- **Mission:** Keep user records accurate without manual SQL or dashboard edits.
- **LLM Backbone:** `gpt-4.0-mini`.
- **Stack:** MuleSoft CloudHub, MCP Server, Supabase, JSON-RPC 2.0.
- **Outcome:** Consistent customer intelligence across the entire Hushh ecosystem.

## 2. Functional Workflow

### Step 1: User Input (Hushh UI / System Request)
A user, agent, or backend service issues a natural-language instruction, such as:  
“Can you update the state to AP for the user with phone +919346661428 and user ID d6f5fca9-924b-492e-95f6-55e81d405174?”

### Step 2: Agent Invocation (MuleSoft Flow)
MuleSoft formats the request as a JSON-RPC 2.0 POST and calls the Supabase Update Agent endpoint, handling authentication and retries.

### Step 3: Intent Extraction & Data Parsing
GPT-4.0 mini identifies:

- User ID and phone number.
- Fields to update (state, email, address, etc.).
- New field values.

### Step 4: Backend MCP Integration
The agent invokes the MCP Server, which runs the tool to commit changes directly in Supabase.

### Step 5: Response Generation
After MCP confirms success, the agent replies with a structured success message, timestamp, and optionally the updated record snapshot.

## 3. Security & Privacy

- All communications are HTTPS-encrypted.
- Only authorized MuleSoft flows can modify user data.
- Supabase credentials remain in MCP-managed vaults.

## User Stories

- **Customer Success Specialist:** Sundar Pichai receives a chat where a VIP says, “I moved to Hyderabad.” She submits the natural language request, and the agent updates Supabase plus Salesforce in under a minute, preventing mismatched campaigns.
- **Field Sales Lead:** Manish Sainani captures notes from a store visit on his phone. By telling the agent “Change Priya’s preferred channel to WhatsApp,” he ensures marketing, support, and analytics immediately operate with the same data.
- **Support Operations Manager:** Mark monitors Zendesk tickets for data issues. When a customer corrects their preferred language, she fires off a quick update command and watches the change cascade to messaging tools automatically.
- **Lifecycle Marketer:** Justin refreshes a VIP segment every Friday. Instead of exporting CSVs, he runs a script that instructs the agent to adjust dozens of small tweaks—new interests, changed budgets—keeping campaigns aligned with reality.
- **Community Coordinator:** Steve Jobs oversees mentorship matches. When mentees update their goals during check-ins, she uses the agent to adjust Supabase tags instantly so mentors always get accurate briefs.
