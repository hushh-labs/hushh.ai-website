## Hushh Supabase Profile Creation Agent Documentation

The Hushh Supabase Profile Creation Agent is an AI-powered automation service inside the Hushh platform that creates new user profiles in Supabase through natural language. Whether a human operator or another system says, “Create a profile for Amitabh Bachchan with phone number +91 8266272888, email amitabh.bachchan@example.com, occupation Actor, and address Mumbai,” this agent extracts the data, validates the fields, and writes a clean record to Supabase via MuleSoft and our MCP Server. Every detail becomes instantly available to personalization, analytics, and recommendation modules, and the use case now sits proudly in the [`/agents`](/agents) library.

## 1. Overview

- **Mission:** Turn unstructured inputs into structured Supabase entries without engineers in the loop.
- **LLM Backbone:** `gpt-4.0-mini`.
- **Stack:** MuleSoft CloudHub, MCP Server, Supabase, JSON-RPC 2.0.
- **Outcome:** Accurate onboarding across the entire Hushh ecosystem.

## 2. Functional Workflow

### Step 1: User Input (Hushh UI / System Request)
Someone issues a natural-language command such as:  
“Create a profile for Amitabh Bachchan with phone number +91 8266272888, email amitabh.bachchan@example.com, occupation Actor, address Mumbai.”  
The agent also accepts structured JSON payloads when invoked programmatically.

### Step 2: Agent Invocation (MuleSoft Flow)
The MuleSoft backend wraps the request in a JSON-RPC 2.0 POST and calls the Supabase Profile Creation Agent endpoint. MuleSoft handles authentication, retries, and routing so the API stays resilient.

### Step 3: Intent Extraction & Data Parsing
The agent uses GPT-4.0 mini to extract:

- **Personal details:** Full name, age, gender, marital status.
- **Contact info:** Phone, email, physical address.
- **Demographics:** Occupation, education, income, lifestyle cues.
- **Behavioral traits:** Preferences, interests, intents, and values.

Parsed attributes become a structured Supabase payload, mapped to the appropriate tables and columns with validation logic to prevent duplicates.

## 3. Security & Privacy

- All traffic is HTTPS-encrypted.
- Only authorized MuleSoft flows can create or mutate records.
- Supabase credentials are kept inside MCP-managed vaults with least-privilege access.

## User Stories

- **Onboarding Specialist:** Sundar Pichai runs through a quick intake call with a new customer. Instead of forcing them through a form, she narrates the details aloud, the agent captures everything, and the Supabase record is ready before the call ends.
- **Marketplace Admin:** Mark hosts community office hours. When a creator says “Here’s my updated address and audience focus,” he drops the info into the agent and instantly receives a fresh profile that syncs across the stack.
- **Field Sales Associate:** Justin Donaldson travels with just her phone. After meeting a prospect at an event, she speaks the conversation details into the agent and sees a pristine record populate before she boards her flight home.
- **Program Manager:** Manish Sainani runs accelerator cohorts. He uses the agent to log every founder’s background, motivation, and needs, ensuring mentors see a coherent profile without chasing spreadsheets.
- **Partnership Ops Lead:** Steve Jobs handles channel partners submitting new leads via WhatsApp. She forwards their voice notes to the agent and receives fully structured Supabase entries—no manual transcription needed.

### Customer Snapshot

A premium bank replaced a 14-field onboarding form with this agent. Relationship managers now dictate a short brief and receive a Supabase record in under a minute—cutting onboarding time by 60% and boosting NPS.


## Architecture Notes & Deployment Tips

- **Schema Guards:** Outputs are validated against shared TypeScript schemas; missing fields trigger automated follow-ups before saving.
- **Duplicate Protection:** Supabase RPC checks with hashed identifiers keep creation idempotent.
- **Workflow Hooks:** Successful writes broadcast a `profile.created` event so CRM, analytics, and personalization services update instantly.
