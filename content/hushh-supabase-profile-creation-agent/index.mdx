## Hushh Supabase Profile Creation Agent Documentation

The Hushh Supabase Profile Creation Agent is an AI-powered automation service inside the Hushh platform that creates new user profiles in Supabase through natural language. Whether a human operator or another system says, “Create a profile for Amitabh Bachchan with phone number +91 8266272888, email amitabh.bachchan@example.com, occupation Actor, and address Mumbai,” this agent extracts the data, validates the fields, and writes a clean record to Supabase via MuleSoft and our MCP Server. Every detail becomes instantly available to personalization, analytics, and recommendation modules, and the use case now sits proudly in the [`/agents`](/agents) library.

## 1. Overview

- **Mission:** Turn unstructured inputs into structured Supabase entries without engineers in the loop.
- **LLM Backbone:** `gpt-4.0-mini`.
- **Stack:** MuleSoft CloudHub, MCP Server, Supabase, JSON-RPC 2.0.
- **Outcome:** Accurate onboarding across the entire Hushh ecosystem.

## 2. Functional Workflow

### Step 1: User Input (Hushh UI / System Request)
Someone issues a natural-language command such as:  
“Create a profile for Amitabh Bachchan with phone number +91 8266272888, email amitabh.bachchan@example.com, occupation Actor, address Mumbai.”  
The agent also accepts structured JSON payloads when invoked programmatically.

### Step 2: Agent Invocation (MuleSoft Flow)
The MuleSoft backend wraps the request in a JSON-RPC 2.0 POST and calls the Supabase Profile Creation Agent endpoint. MuleSoft handles authentication, retries, and routing so the API stays resilient.

### Step 3: Intent Extraction & Data Parsing
The agent uses GPT-4.0 mini to extract:

- **Personal details:** Full name, age, gender, marital status.
- **Contact info:** Phone, email, physical address.
- **Demographics:** Occupation, education, income, lifestyle cues.
- **Behavioral traits:** Preferences, interests, intents, and values.

Parsed attributes become a structured Supabase payload, mapped to the appropriate tables and columns with validation logic to prevent duplicates.

## 3. Security & Privacy

- All traffic is HTTPS-encrypted.
- Only authorized MuleSoft flows can create or mutate records.
- Supabase credentials are kept inside MCP-managed vaults with least-privilege access.
