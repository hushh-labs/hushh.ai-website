## Backed by hushhTech.com — A Proprietary Hedge Fund Fueling Open Research and AI Innovation

### Overview
Hushh Super Intelligence Lab is hiring a founding cohort of India’s best engineers, researchers, and builders to join our open-source, research-first lab. We operate with deep collaboration across IITs, Stanford, and Purdue, and fund our work through our proprietary hedge fund — hushhTech.com.

We’re building core infrastructure for edge intelligence, consent protocols, and personal data agents — and we’re also advancing trading research and agent-based execution strategies for global markets.

We hire smart, ambitious people who want to:
- Build applied AI systems
- Contribute to open-source infrastructure
- Conduct original research
- Explore financial markets and algorithmic design

We pay fairly — competitive by Indian and global standards — and reward clarity of thought, originality, and output.
