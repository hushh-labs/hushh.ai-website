## ✨ Introduction

Design patterns have long been the cornerstone of software architecture—from MVC in web development to factory methods in object-oriented design. Now, as AI becomes more intelligent and autonomous, we need new patterns: agentic design patterns.

This blog explores why these patterns matter, how they help solve recurring challenges in agent development, and how Google’s “21 Agentic Patterns” guide provides a blueprint for building reliable, scalable AI systems.

## 📐 Why Patterns Matter in Agent Development

AI agents are fundamentally different from traditional software modules. They:

- Operate in dynamic environments
- Make probabilistic decisions
- Interact with people and tools
- Learn and evolve over time

This makes them harder to test, debug, and scale. Without structure, things can quickly become chaotic. That’s where patterns come in.

Patterns are reusable strategies that help you:

- Manage memory and state
- Handle failure and recovery
- Enable collaboration between multiple agents
- Integrate safely with tools and APIs
- Align behavior with long-term goals

They’re not rigid templates. They’re flexible, proven strategies that accelerate development while reducing bugs and design debt.

## 🔍 Example Pattern: Prompt Chaining

Let’s take a simple but powerful pattern—Prompt Chaining.

This pattern breaks a task into multiple prompts where each step builds on the previous output. For example:

1.  First prompt generates research questions
2.  Second one finds relevant sources
3.  Third one writes a summary

**Benefits:**

- Modular reasoning (easier to debug)
- Step-by-step verification
- Intermediary checkpoints for validation

Used correctly, prompt chaining transforms LLMs from monolithic generators into reasoned problem-solvers.

## 🤖 Example Pattern: Tool Use

Another essential pattern is Tool Use—which enables agents to access capabilities beyond the model, like APIs, calculators, or databases.

Instead of hallucinating answers to questions like “What’s the weather in Tokyo?”, the agent calls a real API, interprets the result, and responds factually.

Tool use adds a new dimension to agents—it turns them from “smart responders” into actors that can affect the world.

## 🧩 Other Patterns in the Book

The guide covers 21 patterns in total. Some highlights include:

- **Reflection** – Agents analyze their past output to self-correct
- **Planning** – Decomposing goals into sub-tasks
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Dividing roles and responsibilities across agents
- **Memory Management** – Storing, retrieving, and summarizing long-term state
- **Guardrails** – Ensuring safe and ethical behavior

Each pattern comes with real code examples using frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, Crew AI, and Google ADK.

## 🎯 When to Use These Patterns

If you’re building:

- A customer service agent with multiple hand-off stages
- A data analyst agent that needs long-term memory and SQL access
- A writing assistant that offers critique before completion

...then these patterns will save you hours of trial-and-error.

## 📢 Conclusion: Design Smarter, Not Just Faster

As agents become core components of AI products, it’s no longer enough to hack together flows with one-shot prompts. You need system thinking. You need repeatable patterns. You need to design agentically. Whether you’re using LangChain or building from scratch, these design patterns give you the blueprint for resilient, scalable, and intelligent agents. Don’t just build AI. Build agents that think, act, and collaborate.
