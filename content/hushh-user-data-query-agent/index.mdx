## 🧠 Hushh User Data Query Agent

The Hushh User Data Query Agent is an intelligent, AI-driven interface that retrieves complete user intelligence using a single identifier—their phone number. Acting as the connective tissue between branded chat surfaces, CRMs, WhatsApp agents, and the Supabase knowledge graph, it responds with structured, conversational insights that marketing and service teams can trust. Hosted on MuleSoft CloudHub with HTTPS-by-default security, it is now featured alongside other orchestration blueprints on [`/agents`](/agents).

## 1. Overview

- **Purpose:** Deliver instant, structured answers about any customer profile.
- **LLM Backbone:** `gpt-4.0-mini`.
- **Stack:** MuleSoft CloudHub, Supabase, Salesforce CRM extensions, JSON-RPC 2.0 requests.
- **Outcome:** Personalized engagement without manual lookups or dashboard diving.

## 2. Concept Example — “Sundar Pichai Query Agent”

Imagine a concierge assistant called “Sundar Pichai Query Agent.” When Nike’s brand bot wants to know Sundar’s background, education, or lifestyle cues, it simply asks: “Tell me about Sundar Pichai’s preferences.” The Hushh User Data Query Agent routes that request, fetches verified data, and responds instantly. Every user in your CRM now has their own digital intelligence layer—discoverable through natural language and showcased on [`/agents`](/agents).

## 3. Example Queries

| Query | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Can you fetch all the details of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Returns the complete Supabase profile. |
| Can you fetch all the intentions/wants/desires of the user? | Surfaces intent, goals, and aspirational signals. |
| What are the fitness details or lifestyle preferences? | Shares activity, health, and routine context. |
| What is the education level/occupation of the user? | Provides academic and professional metadata. |
| Can you fetch past or future purchase intents? | Summarizes historical and predicted buying signals. |
| Can you fetch needs, purchase intent details, or marital status? | Consolidates needs-based intelligence and demographic data. |
| Can you fetch contact details? | Returns verified contact info from Supabase. |
| Does the user like tea or coffee? | Answers lifestyle micro-preferences for campaign tailoring. |

## 4. How It Works

1. A brand agent or chatbot submits a plain-language request with the user’s phone number.
2. The Hushh Query Agent interprets the prompt, maps it to Supabase schemas, and enriches with Salesforce data when needed.
3. The agent fetches structured results and uses GPT-4.0 mini to craft a conversational, human-readable summary.
4. Both the narrative answer and raw JSON are returned so downstream systems can act immediately.

## 5. Key Features

## 6. Typical Workflow

1. **Brand Agent asks:** “Can you fetch the occupation of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403)?”
2. **Query Agent retrieves:** Pulls the occupation field from Supabase (and enriches with CRM attributes if available).
3. **Response delivered:** “The occupation of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403 is Software Engineer,” plus a machine-readable payload for automation.

## 7. Security & Privacy
