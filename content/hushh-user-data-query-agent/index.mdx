## 🧠 Hushh User Data Query Agent

The Hushh User Data Query Agent is an intelligent, AI-driven interface that retrieves complete user intelligence using a single identifier—their phone number. Acting as the connective tissue between branded chat surfaces, CRMs, WhatsApp agents, and the Supabase knowledge graph, it responds with structured, conversational insights that marketing and service teams can trust. Hosted on MuleSoft CloudHub with HTTPS-by-default security, it is now featured alongside other orchestration blueprints on [`/agents`](/agents).

## 1. Overview

- **Purpose:** Deliver instant, structured answers about any customer profile.
- **LLM Backbone:** `gpt-4.0-mini`.
- **Stack:** MuleSoft CloudHub, Supabase, Salesforce CRM extensions, JSON-RPC 2.0 requests.
- **Outcome:** Personalized engagement without manual lookups or dashboard diving.

## 2. Concept Example — “Sundar Pichai Query Agent”

Imagine a concierge assistant called “Sundar Pichai Query Agent.” When Nike’s brand bot wants to know Sundar’s background, education, or lifestyle cues, it simply asks: “Tell me about Sundar Pichai’s preferences.” The Hushh User Data Query Agent routes that request, fetches verified data, and responds instantly. Every user in your CRM now has their own digital intelligence layer—discoverable through natural language and showcased on [`/agents`](/agents).

## 3. Example Queries

| Query | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Can you fetch all the details of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403? | Returns the complete Supabase profile. |
| Can you fetch all the intentions/wants/desires of the user? | Surfaces intent, goals, and aspirational signals. |
| What are the fitness details or lifestyle preferences? | Shares activity, health, and routine context. |
| What is the education level/occupation of the user? | Provides academic and professional metadata. |
| Can you fetch past or future purchase intents? | Summarizes historical and predicted buying signals. |
| Can you fetch needs, purchase intent details, or marital status? | Consolidates needs-based intelligence and demographic data. |
| Can you fetch contact details? | Returns verified contact info from Supabase. |
| Does the user like tea or coffee? | Answers lifestyle micro-preferences for campaign tailoring. |

## 4. How It Works

1. A brand agent or chatbot submits a plain-language request with the user’s phone number.
2. The Hushh Query Agent interprets the prompt, maps it to Supabase schemas, and enriches with Salesforce data when needed.
3. The agent fetches structured results and uses GPT-4.0 mini to craft a conversational, human-readable summary.
4. Both the narrative answer and raw JSON are returned so downstream systems can act immediately.

## 5. Key Features

- ✅ **Single Identifier Querying:** Phone number is all you need.
- ✅ **AI-Driven Understanding:** Natural questions resolve to deterministic data calls.
- ✅ **Rich User Intelligence:** Wants, needs, behavioral preferences, and consumption signals.
- ✅ **Forecasting Support:** Infers future purchase intent from historical data plus LLM reasoning.
- ✅ **Seamless Integration:** Fits into WhatsApp bots, web chat, CRMs, and any agent listed on [`/agents`](/agents).
- ✅ **Secured Endpoint:** CloudHub hosting with HTTPS, token-based auth, and MCP secrets.

## 6. Typical Workflow

1. **Brand Agent asks:** “Can you fetch the occupation of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403)?”
2. **Query Agent retrieves:** Pulls the occupation field from Supabase (and enriches with CRM attributes if available).
3. **Response delivered:** “The occupation of the user with phone number (637) 940-5403 is Software Engineer,” plus a machine-readable payload for automation.

## 7. Security & Privacy

- All communication is TLS-encrypted.
- Only approved MuleSoft flows can create or modify user records.
- Supabase credentials remain within MCP-managed vaults for least-privilege access.

## User Stories

- **Support Champion:** Levi fields a ticket asking, “Why was my last offer off-base?” She queries the agent via phone number, immediately seeing the user’s updated intents and adjusting the upsell to match their travel plans.
- **Growth PM:** Manish Sainani tests a new referral perk. Each time a referred user signs up, he pings the agent to confirm lifestyle traits and see which perks resonate, letting him iterate messaging in hours, not weeks.
- **Community Moderator:** Justin reviews a membership application with only a phone number. The agent summarizes the applicant’s interests and goals, helping her approve and route them to the right sub-community instantly.
- **Account Strategist:** William prepares for quarterly reviews with enterprise clients. Before each meeting he runs a quick query to capture evolving needs, ensuring his presentation highlights the most relevant initiatives.
- **Voice Assistant Designer:** James trains conversational scripts for a kiosk. She uses anonymized agent outputs to ensure intents and desires represented in the script match real customer motivations.

## Architecture, Tips, and Story

- **Fan-Out Responses:** Besides rendering a conversational answer, the agent publishes the raw JSON onto an event bus so analytics, CRM, and marketing automation subscribe without extra API calls.
- **Latency Guardrails:** Requests exceeding 2 seconds trigger a lightweight fallback that returns previously cached context plus a notice about refresh status, keeping CS agents productive during spikes.
- **Prompt Libraries:** Team-specific prompt variants (support vs. marketing vs. growth) live in Supabase, letting each stakeholder fine-tune outputs without code changes.

### Customer Story Snapshot

A telco pilot connected the User Data Query Agent to its WhatsApp concierge. When subscribers asked about upgrade eligibility, the bot fetched wants, needs, and device history instantly, allowing human reps to craft bespoke offers and shrinking resolution time by 35%.

## Day 0 Story — Sundar Pichai Concierge View

1. **Creation & enrichment:** Sundar’s minimal intake (name, phone, email) flows through the Supabase Profile Creation Agent. GeminiAI Public Data Agent enriches the record with executive bio, investing behavior, and lifestyle cues.
2. **KYC polishing:** The Supabase Profile Update Agent patches accreditation proof, preferred contact channel, and travel cadence, locking the information against Sundar’s MCP alias (`https://hushh.ai/profile/sundar-pichai`).
3. **Endpoint promotion:** MuleSoft publishes the alias internally as both a phone-based URL (`https://hushh.ai/profile/phone/+16505559001`) and an MCP tool descriptor. Any agent can now request “Sundar’s wants” without juggling IDs.
4. **Concierge response:** When Sundar’s dedicated WhatsApp concierge poses “What matters most to Sundar Pichai right now?”, the User Data Query Agent fans out to Supabase, Salesforce, and cached Gemini outputs, returning a conversational summary plus machine-readable JSON for the bot and the KYC investor workspace.
5. **Day 0 complete:** Within minutes of the first input, Sundar has a searchable, AI-enriched profile that every support, sales, and investor-relations workflow can query safely.
